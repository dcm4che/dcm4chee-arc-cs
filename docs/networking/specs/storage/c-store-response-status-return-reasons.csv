This status is returned if the DICOM Object stream can be successfully parsed but does not contain values for one or more mandatory Elements of the SOP Class. The STORAGE-SCP AE does not perform a comprehensive check, as it only checks a subset of required Elements. In addition, if the SOP Class is for a type of image but the SOP Instance does not contain values necessary for its display then this status is returned. Error message is output to the Service Log. The system can be configured to temporarily save such Data Sets in order to aid problem diagnosis."
